# Flight results

Due to an incorrect value for the flight duration in the MicroPython program, the data logging was only made for 30 minutes of which only 10 correspond to the flight (up to an altitude of 2600 m).

The flight peaked at 34 km altitude. Its total duration was 2h15.

Thank you to the IRM for allowing us to use its balloon and a very big thanks for the radio amateurs of the [UBA](https://www.uba.be/fr/radioamateurisme) who recovered the probe.
