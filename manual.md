## How to use the system.

To program and retrieve files from the Raspberry Pi Pico I used the Thonny IDE.

I worked with two interpreters : 

- The default Thonny interpreter, running on my computer.
- The MicroPython interpreter running on the Pico board.

The interface is the following :

- `1` is the current directory on my computer.
- `2` is the current directory on the Pico.
- `3` shows which interpreter is in use (to change click on this item).

To show the file windows click on View menu and then Files

*Interpreter choice :*

For information about installing MicroPython interpreter see [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html).

### Program installation.

Connect the Pico to your computer with PICO-UPS-A board switch in OFF position.

In your working directory install `acc_pt_log.py`, `icm20948_mod.py`, `lps22hb_mod.py` and `bin_to_csv.py`

`icm20948_mod.py`, `lps22hb_mod.py` are in the embedded-sensors repository : [Pico_IMU_10DOF](https://github.com/pcamus/embedded-sensors/tree/main/Pico_IMU_10DOF/my_IMU_code)

Rename `acc_pt_log.py` as `main.py` (MicroPython starts automatically main.py at reset).

With the MicroPython interpreter selected, copy `main.py`, `icm20948_mod.py` and `lps22hb_mod.py` to the Pico (right click on the files then Upload to /)

Disconnect your computer. The logging will start when you switch ON the PICO-UPS-A and will last for a time equal to the value of the `LOG_TIME` variable (in `main.py`). The Pico LED will flash slowly twice indication that the initialisation of the chips is successful, then the LED will toggle at each sampling of the acceleration.

### Retrieving data files.

Connect the Pico to your computer with PICO-UPS-A board switch in OFF position and select the MicroPython interpreter.

This will automatically start a new acquisition, so stop it by clicking on the stop button. Then refresh the Raspberry Pi Pico file window (menu at the top right of the window).

Then click right successively on the `acc.bin` and `Press_Temp.bin` files and choose Download to... The files will be copied in your computer directory.

**Then switch to the default interpreter** (running on your computer) and run the `bin_to_csv.py` program. If you don't switch to the default interpreter the `bin_to_csv.py` program will try to create the csv files into the Pico flash memory which is not big enough for this !

After refreshing the file window, `acc.csv` and `Press_Temp.csv` will be there.

### Starting a new log session.

Connect the Pico to your computer with PICO-UPS-A board switch in OFF position and select the MicroPython interpreter.

This will automatically start a new acquisition, so stop it by clicking on the stop button. Then refresh the Raspberry Pi Pico file window (menu at the top right of the window).

Then click right successively on the `acc.bin` and `Press_Temp.bin` files and choose Delete. The files will be removed from the Pico flash memor thus leaving room for a new data logging.

Disconnect your computer. The logging will start when you switch ON the PICO-UPS-A.

### Using the data.

After conversion, two files are available : 

- `acc.csv` with the X,Y,Z acceleration values. In this setup the accelerations range from -32768 Ã  +32767 corresponding to -2g to +2g and the sampling rate is 100 ms.
- `Press_Temp.csv` with pressure and temperature values. The pressure is in hPa and the temperature in Celsius degree with one decimal. The sampling rate is 10s.
